## 1 | Machine Learning for Additive Manufacturing 
### Creating a machine learning classification algorithm for additive manufacturing using *MATLAB*

> Part of my final year thesis for completion of my Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Warwick

### Abstract

Methodology and analysis of the development of a software and a machine learning (ML) algorithm for image extraction and classification of a Selective Laser Melting (SLM) additive manufacturing (AM) process is presented. The programmes were created by means of the MATLAB R2020b software package and the video of the surface of the powder bed of the SLM printer was captured using the XirisTM XVC-1100 smart camera. For all frames of the video captured, mean b* colour values were obtained and compared, identifying the precise frames required for analysis. An accuracy of 99% was achieved, proving the aptness of the software for Laser-Powder Bed Fusion layer-wise quality monitoring. Thereafter, a Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) ML algorithm was trained using the collected frames, which was subsequently tested, achieving a 92.1% accuracy. Several validation techniques were utilised, confirming software integrity. Finally, the impact of the developed programmes was outlined, focusing on their significance for research and evaluation of the effect of AM process parameters in print quality, and the opportunities for implementation in real-time AM quality monitoring systems.

### The Code

#### Code for image database collection 

*Read video and initialise variables.*

    % Reading video
    v = VideoReader('FullVideo.avi');
    % Obtain number of frames in video
    NumOfFrames = v.NumFrames;
  
    % Set Up matrices
    meanB = zeros(NumOfFrames, 1); % Matrix containing mean b* values
    mean50B = zeros(50,1); % Matrix containing mean b* values of past 50 frames
    minimum = zeros(NumOfFrames-50, 1); % Matrix containing minium values of past 50 frames
    Identifying frames based on mean b* values.
  
    % Initial for loop to obtain Mean b* of all frames
    for frame = 1:NumOfFrames
      thisFrame = read(v,frame);
      cform = makecform('srgb2lab'); % Change frame from rgb to lab colour space
      LabFrame = applycform(im2double(thisFrame),cform);
      meanB(frame) = mean2(LabFrame(:,:,3)); % Obtain mean b* value
    end

    % For loop to obtain array of minimum values
    for i = 1:(NumOfFrames - 50)
      mean50B = meanB(i:i+50);
      minimum(i) = min(mean50B); % Minimum value os past 50 frames mean b*
    end

    % For loop to write and compare mininum
    for j = 7:(NumOfFrames-50)
        if minimum(j) < (minimum(j-6)/2) % Compare minimum values of current frame and 6th frame prior
          outputBaseFileName = sprintf('Frame %4.4d.png', (j+44)); % File name based on frame number
          outputFullFileName = fullfile('D:\', 'frames', outputBaseFileName); % Folder to save frames in
          Frame = read(v,j+44); % Read frame
          imwrite(Frame, outputFullFileName); % Save frame in folder indicated above
        end
    end

*Delete files from same cycle that are unnecessary.*

    d = dir('D:\frames\Not valuable frames'); % Access folder
    filenames = {d.name};% Access all filenames
    Pnum = 00; % Define variable for previous file number
    
    for i = 1:numel(filenames)
      fn = filenames{i}; % Access file name of specific file
      % Find all files that contain space and find first 2 digits of frame
      [num, cnt] = sscanf(fn(find(fn == ' ', 1, 'last')+1:end-6), '%d');
      % If statement to delete files with the same first 2 digits
      if cnt == 1 && isequal(num,Pnum)
        delete(fullfile('D:\frames\Not valuable frames', fn));
      end
      Pnum = num;
    end

Manually select coordinates for image cropping

    % h = imshow('Frame 0431.png'); % Show first frame saved
    hp = impixelinfo; % Show location of pointer in frame
    set(hp,'Position',[5 1 300 20]); % Position of information of location
    Save cropped images
    d2 = dir('D:\frames') % Establis folder to analyse
    filenames = {d2.name}; % Find all filenames in the folder

    % For loop to save cropped images
    for i = 3: numel(filenames) % For all files
    fn = filenames{iB; % Get current file number
    I = imread(fn); % Read frame of current file
    P1 = imcrop(I,[435 342 760 60]); % Crop frame for Sample 1 coordinates
    P2 = imcrop(I,[435 465 760 60]); % Crop frame for Sample 2 coordinates
    P3 = imcrop(I,[411 663 760 60]); % Crop frame for Sample 3 coordinates

    % Save cropped images to desired folder and with desired name, S1,S2,S3
    outputBaseFileName = sprintf('P1 %12s.png', fn);
    outputFullFileName = fullfile('D:\S1', outputBaseFileName);
    imwrite(P1, outputFullFileName);
    outputBaseFileName = sprintf('P2 %12s.png', fn);
    outputFullFileName = fullfile('D:\S2',outputBaseFileName);
    imwrite(P2, outputFullFileName);
    outputBaseFileName = sprintf('P3 %12s.png', fn);
    outputFullFileName = fullfile('D:\S3', outputBaseFileName);
    imwrite(P3, outputFullFileName);
    end

#### Code for Image Classification 

*Establish datasets using ImageDataStore function.*

    File = fullfile('C:\Training and Test Set');
    DB = imageDatastore(File,'IncludeSubfolders', true, 'LabelSource','foldernames');
    
*Display class names and counts.*
    
    Table = countEachLabel(DB)
    Categories = tbl.Label;

*Partition 336 images for training and 228 for testing.*

    Ilocation = fileparts(DB.Files{1});
    imgSet = imageSet(strcat(Ilocation,'\..'),'recursive'); % Recursively scan entire image set folder
    [training_set,test_set] = imgSet.partition(113); % Create training and test set
    test_set = test_set.partition(76);
    
*Create visual vocabulary.*
    
    tic % Start timer
    % Use bagOfFeatures function to create vocabulary
    % Set vocabulary size, type of feature point selection
    % and amount of features to select from (Final was 7, grid, 80%)
    BoVW = bagOfFeatures(training_set, 'VocabularySize',7,'PointSelection','Grid','StrongestFeatures', 0.8);
    % Create array of presence of visual words on each image
    imgdata = double(encode(BoVW, tr_set));
    toc % Stop timer
    return; % Stop running code

*Visualise/Plot histograms of feature vectors.*

    % Plot histogram of random S1 image
    img = read(training_set(1), randi(training_set(1).Count));
    featureVector = encode(BoVW, img); % Encode data from BoVW
    subplot(1,3,1); % Establish 1x3 image
    bS1 = bar(featureVector, 'FaceColor', [0 0.7 0]);
    titS1 = title({'Visual Word Occurrences of','Image in S1 Training Set'});
    xlabS1 = xlabel('Visual Word Index');
    ylabS1 = ylabel('Frequency ()');

    % Set font and size
    set(gca, 'FontName', 'Times New Roman')
    set([xlabS1,ylabS1], 'FontSize', 13)
    set([titS1], 'FontSize', 15)
    
    % Plot histogram of random S2 image
    img = read(tr_set(2), randi(tr_set(2).Count));
    featureVector = encode(BoVW, img);
    subplot(1,3,2);
    bS2 = bar(featureVector, 'FaceColor', [0 0.5 0]);
    titS2 = title({'Visual Word Occurrences of','Image in S2 Training Set'});
    xlabS2 = xlabel('Visual Word Index');
    ylabS2 = ylabel('Frequency (%)');
    
    % Set font and size
    set(gca, 'FontName', 'Times New Roman')
    set([xlabS2,ylabS2], 'FontSize', 13)
    set([titS2], 'FontSize', 15)
    
    % Plot histogram of random S3 image
    img = read(tr_set(3), randi(tr_set(3).Count));
    featureVector = encode(BoVW, img);
    subplot(1,3,3);
    bS3 = bar(featureVector, 'FaceColor', [0 0.3 0]);
    titS3 = title({'Visual Word Occurrences of','Image in S3 Training Set'});
    xlabS3 = xlabel('Visual Word Index');
    ylabS3 = ylabel('Frequency (%)');
    
    % Set font and size
    set(gca, 'FontName', 'Times New Roman')
    set([xlabS3,ylabS3], 'FontSize', 13)
    set([titS3], 'FontSize', 15)

*Create a 339x8 table using the encoded features*

    ImageData = array2table(imgdata); % Convert array created earlier to table
    % Link each category with each feature vector
    Type = categorical(repelem({training_set.Description}', [training_set.Count], 1));
    ImageData.Type = Type;

*Use the image data to train a model and assess its performance using Classification learner*
*Open Classification Learner and import trained model*
    
    classificationLearner
    
*Test out accuracy on testing set*

    tic % Start timer
    testImData = double(encode(BoVW, test_set));
    testImData = array2table(testImData,'VariableNames',M0780.RequiredVariables); % Implement imported model
    actualImType = categorical(repelem({test_set.Description}', [test_set.Count], 1)); % Obtain actual category
    
    predictedOutcome = M0780.predictFcn(testImData); % Implement imported model M0780 to test

    % Count correct predictions by comparing obtained classification and actual category
    correctPredictions = (predictedOutcome == actualImType);
    validationAccuracy = sum(correctPredictions)/length(predictedOutcome) % Calculate validation accuracy
