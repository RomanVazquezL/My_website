## Sponge

From an early age I have benefited from being what I have denominated as a *sponge*. This means that I am able to soak in all information around me quickly and make use of it. This also implies that my personality, manners and desires change depending on the people that I surround myself with, which can be both beneficial and a disadvantage. Luckily, I have been lucky to have a **great family and friends throughout my life**, who have guided me through the right path.
