<div id="who-am-i" class="section level2">
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I come from La Coru√±a, a city in the northwest region of Spain, surrounded by water and where you can eat the best spanish <em>tortilla</em> and octopus <em>a la gallega</em>. There I spent my first 18 years of life, after which I moved to Royal Leamington Spa in the UK to study Mechanical Engineering at the University of Warwick, driven by my passion for both multiculturality and applied problem-solving.</p>
<p>After 3 years of exponential personal growth, I graduated with a first class and with a immense appetite for solving high-impact problems. To suffice my hunger, I am learning about data analytics at London Business School, and pursuing a career in consulting in London.</p>

<div id="sponge" class="section level2">
<h2>Sponge</h2>
<p>From an early age I have benefited from being what I have denominated as a <em>sponge</em>. This means that I am able to soak in all information around me quickly and make use of it. This also implies that my personality, manners and desires change depending on the people that I surround myself with, which can be both beneficial and a disadvantage. Luckily, I have been lucky to have a <strong>great family and friends throughout my life</strong>, who have guided me through the right path.</p>

<div id="my-hobbies" class="section level2">
<h2>My hobbies</h2>
<p>Whenever I have time, I practice sports. Here are a few photos that showcase what I usually do in my free time.</p>

<p>Having lived next to the see my whole life, I like to practice water sports, especially windsurf and sailing. Being individual sports, they give me time to think, and through them I have been able to learn how to come up with solutions in desperate times from an early age. Find me here with afro!</p>

<p>There has not been a year in which I had not played basketball, having competed at a national level in Spain, in the UK against other universities and now as part of the London Business School team.</p>
