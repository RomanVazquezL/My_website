## Who am I? 
I come from La Coru√±a, a city in the northwest region of Spain, surrounded by water and where you can eat the best spanish *tortilla* and octopus *a la gallega*. There I spent my first 18 years of life, after which I moved to Royal Leamington Spa in the UK to study Mechanical Engineering at the University of Warwick, driven by my passion for both multiculturality and applied problem-solving.  

After 3 years of exponential personal growth, I graduated with a first class and with a immense appetite for solving high-impact problems. To suffice my hunger, I am learning about data analytics at London Business School, and pursuing a career in consulting in London. 

## Sponge
From an early age I have benefited from being what I have denominated as a *sponge*. This means that I am able to soak in all information around me quickly and make use of it. This also implies that my personality, manners and desires change depending on the people that I surround myself with, which can be both beneficial and a disadvantage. Luckily, I have been lucky to have a **great family and friends throughout my life**, who have guided me through the right path.

## My hobbies


Whenever I have time, I practice sports. Here are a few photos that showcase what I usually do in my free time. Having lived next to the see my whole life, I like to practice water sports, especially windsurf and sailing. Being individual sports, they give me time to think, and through them I have been able to learn how to come up with solutions in desperate times from an early age.

There has not been a year in which I had not played basketball, having competed at a national level in Spain, in the UK against other universities and now as part of the London Business School team.Find me in the photo with number 16 with my team at University.
